Charts data fed through serial port(USB)  of android device in host mode via OTG or usb host port



<p>Issue 1:  AC signals have zero between every data point</p>
<p><strike>Issue 2:  Pause and toggle buttons dont work yet</strike></p>
<p>Issue 3:  How to get accuracy from serial port wihout reducing speed</p>
<p>Issue 4:  App crashes when the back button is presses while in a charting activity_>debatable, only observed on toshiba tablet</p>
<p>Issue 5:  Connect/Disconnect button on splash screen does not work</p>
<p>Issue 6:  For smartphone with smaller batteries, may not power arduino properly, will it work with alternate power source?</p>
<p>Issue 7:  Capture data in buffer and only display one time interval</p>
<p>Issue 8:  Label x values in units of time</p>
<p>Issue 9:  Provide buttons to choose which channel the graph may take data from</p>
<p><strike>Issue 10: Change ICON</strike></p>
<p>Issue 11: Allow opening and closing of serial port via button, instead of automatic action, tied to issue 5</p>
<p>Issue 12: Chart is lost of one leaves the activity</p>
<p>Issue 13: Graph and app by extension gets slow when charting for a while, especially if view port covers entire graph</p>
<p>Issue 14: Graphs charting looks like crap</p>
<p>Issue 15: Create a settings activity, allow user to change serial protocols like baud rate, parity e.t.c.</p>
<p>Issue 16: Allow users to change colour of graph or lines for charting</p>
<p>Issue 17: App looks too basic, improve User Interface, add animations</p>
<p><strike>Issue 18: Saved graph images overwrite previously saved graph images of the same type</strike></p>
<p>Issue 19: AutoSet feature does not work 100% of the time</p>
<p>Issue 20: Lots of data points are dropped during charting, reduces the apprent smaple rate on graph</p>
<p>Issue 21: App slows down, crashes even, when the number of points is increased, UI thread doing too much work</p>
<p>Issue 22: Passing data to Splash is unecessary, do intial calculations in service and pass data to charting activies</p>
